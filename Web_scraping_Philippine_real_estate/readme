Have created this web scraping script to be able to gather information for real estate in the Philippines
This was inspired by the available datasets on Kaggle regarding housing prices on other countries and was 
used to create machine learning models to predict house prices.

Having been born and raised in the Philippines, I wanted to create something similar for real estate there, 
but after searching online, I am unable to find datasets i can use.

Thus, i have created this web scraping script to gather information from this major real estate website 
that has listings in places like Mexico, Indonesia & Philippines. It is called "lamudi"

Here's the link: https://www.lamudi.com.ph/

I also have included the output CSV file.

I plan to add more columns/features in the future

Once data is sufficient, i also plan to create a machine learning model to predict housing prices in the Philippines

Update (3/14/22):

I also have loaded this into Tableau public 
to create a geographical visualization of house & lots for sale in the Philippines.
I also have used used color & size to show price differences in a glance of the map
